# Section Layout

The challenge is to reproduce this page from the specification. 

* Start by building the three sections and getting the background colors to span the entire rows, and the text to have the specified width of 620px.

* After you have hard-coded the width, change it to be a percentage of the overall width.

* Make sure the image works when you shrink the width.

* Use max-width to prevent the text from stretching to far across the screen.
