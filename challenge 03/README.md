# Section Layout

The challenge is to reproduce this page from the specification. 

Start by building the three sections and getting the background colors to span the entire rows, and the text to have the specified width of 620px.

After you have hard-coded the width, change it to be a percentage of the overall width.

Make sure the image works when you shrink the width.
